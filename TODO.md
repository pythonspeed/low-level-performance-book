* Explain why NumPy arrays are fast to access better (slide deck somewhere that covers this?)
* Go over all code samples, make sure they're using minimal NumPyisms.
* Document existence of `py-perf-event`, `perf` command-line tool.
* Hightlight changed code with https://github.com/shafayetShafee/line-highlight
* Something about deciding when it's worth it to optimize, re business goals
* Add link to more projects mentioned inline, e.g. `cibuildwheel`.
* Mark winning entries in performance with ðŸ¥‡
* Make sure sad emojis are consistent
* Alt text for all charts/images
* Maybe move microbenchmarking, or some of it, earlier, so people trying to reproduce don't get confusing results?
* Moving average can use same trick as median filter (subtract from start, add to end).
