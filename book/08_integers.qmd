# Integers

faster than floats, typically

Wrapping behavior

signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C

In Numba, documentation says "arithmetic operations can wrapround or produce undefined results or overflow."

TODO maybe restructure? this doesn't quite belong here: smaller types can result in speed ups for multiple reason - possibly faster math, can fit more operations into single SIMD instruction, reduced memory accesses
