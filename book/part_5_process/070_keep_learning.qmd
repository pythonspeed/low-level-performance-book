# Keep learning

This book is just the start at building your mental model of how to write fast code.
There is much more you can learn if you want to optimize your code even more.
Here are some books I can recommend as a starting point on low-level programming:

* [_Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd edition_](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/), by Bryant and O'Halloran.
  This textbook covers how CPUs work, but unlike most it focuses only on the parts that are relevant to programmers.
* [_Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPUs, 2nd Edition_](https://easyperf.net/), by Denis Bakhalov.
  This free book talks about critical tools for measuring performance, and how to interpret their results; I paid for the printed version.
  He also has a [free online course](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja).
* [_Algorithms for Modern Hardware_](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/), by Sergey Slotin, is a free online book.

All of these require at least a basic knowledge of the C programming language.

The following two books cover Python performance more broadly:

* [_High Performance Python, 3rd edition_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781098165956/), by Gorelick and Oszvald.
  I contributed a tiny section on Rust.
* [_Fast Python_](https://www.manning.com/books/fast-python), by Antao.

And of course by applying the techniques in this book, you will keep learning and improving your skills.
