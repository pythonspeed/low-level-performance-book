Most of the examples in this book are small functions; it's clear where the bottleneck is.
Real-world code is often far more complex, with many functions, classes, modules, and libraries in use.
That means you need some way to identify which part of all this is the bottleneck.
One way to do that is with a profiler.

## Know what the profiler is measuring

## Choose the right visualization (line-based, flamegraph, timeline)
