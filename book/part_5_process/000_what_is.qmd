# What is the Practice of Process?

> "... most industrial enterprises contain an aesthetic of products—a language, a set of concepts, and a framework for judging the beauty of products—but few contain an equally well developed _aesthetic of process_."

All other things being equal, faster software is better software.
It gets you results faster, it uses less resources, it's more efficient: all good qualities to have in a product.

To achieve a faster product you also need to consider your software development processes.
Why did your software end up slow in the first place?
How will you measure your software's speed and validate it actually is getting faster?
How will you keep your software from getting slow again in the future as it continues to evolve?

These are all questions not about your code, but about your development process.
The Practice of Process covers the processes you use to make your software fast, and to keep it fast.
