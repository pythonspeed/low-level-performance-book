# Document your code

Code that has been optimized for speed can often be less readable, because it prioritizes the needs of the CPU or compiler rather than needs of the reader.

## Consider providing a reference implementation

## Add comments explaining how your code works, and how you optimized it

## Add type annotations and use a type checker
