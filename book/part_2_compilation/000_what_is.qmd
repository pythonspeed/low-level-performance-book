title: "What is the Practice of Compilation?"
---

Python code usually runs slowly, at least when using the default interpreter.
So one way to speed up Python code is to replace it with code written in a faster compiled language: the Practice of Compilation.

This can include:

* Using compiled APIs that are already part of Python.
* Using pre-existing Python libraries written in compiled languages.
* Writing your own compiled code.

If you're doing the latter, you also need to understand the limitations of the compiler's optimizations, and how to work around those limitations.
