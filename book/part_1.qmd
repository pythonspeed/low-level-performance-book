# A simple mental model for computing speed

Implementation matters for speed (NumPy vs Python code example?), you can't ignore how underlying system works.

We'll start with simple model. Later we'll see how this model is wrong, but it's a reasonable starting point.

At this point our mental model of the CPU doesn't have to be particularly accurate.
For now we'll just make the reasonable assumption that if we ask the CPU to run 10Ã— as many instructions, the CPU will take longer to do so.
