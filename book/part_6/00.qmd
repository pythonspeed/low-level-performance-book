# Make memory access more efficient

So far we've been ignoring memory reads and writes, assuming that they're fairly fast and take a fixed amount of time.
As always, a more accurate mental model can help you speed up our code.

As it turns out, from a CPU's perspective, reading from RAM—the active memory of the computer—is actually quite slow.
To speed things up, CPU designers provide a series of caches to reduce the need to access RAM.
Recently used data is stored in those caches, and that speeds up memory access... some of the time.
If the data you need isn't in a fast cache, you might end up with a slow memory read from RAM.
