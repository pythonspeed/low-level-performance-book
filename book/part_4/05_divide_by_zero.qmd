# Use faster division-by-zero handling when possible

Another source of hidden branches is division by zero.

Dividing by zero is mathematically meaningless, so programming languages need to decide how to handle it for different data types.
For example, in Python you get a `ZeroDivisionError` by default, whereas NumPy floats return the special value `inf`/`-inf`/`nan` when divided by zero (for positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero, respectively).

If your programming language has any sort of graceful handling for divide by zero, behind the scenes that will require generating an `if` statement any time division by a variable happens.
Numba, for example, will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` by default.
