# Get rid of edge case branches

Some branches are there to handle a rare edge case.
Given most data won't be an edge choice, the branch should be easy to predict.
Even so, calling the same code over and over in an inner loop is a waste of resources; ideally you'd just handle edge cases separately.

```{python}
# Import the dependencies we'll need:
import numpy as np
from numba import njit
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
%load_ext book_magics
```

## Example: A literal edge case

Let's say we have a time series of daily values between 0 and 1, and we want to calculate the 7-day moving average.
For most values we just calculate the average of the previous (inclusive) 7 values.
But for the first 6 days, we won't have sufficient previous values.
There are various strategies to deal with this missing data, and in this case we'll just repeat the value in the first day:

```{python}
DATA = np.random.random((1_000_000,))

@njit
def moving_average(timeseries):
    result = np.empty(timeseries.shape, dtype=np.float64)
    first_day = timeseries[0]
    for i in range(len(timeseries)):
        total = 0
        if i < 6:
            # Fill in missing values for first few days:
            total += (6 - i) * first_day
        for j in range(max(i - 6, 0), i + 1):
            total += timeseries[j]
        result[i] = total / 7
    return result
```

One performance problem with this code is the `if i < 6`: it's being called on every single iteration of the loop, even though it's only needed for the first 6 iterations.

## Don't use branchless code when the branch is predictable

In the previous chapter we saw how we can replace branches with branchless code, which can help get rid of the cost of mispredicted branches.
We can do that here too:

```{python}
@njit
def moving_average_branchless(timeseries):
    result = np.empty(timeseries.shape, dtype=np.float64)
    first_day = timeseries[0]
    for i in range(len(timeseries)):
        # Fill in missing values for first few days:
        total = first_day * max(6 - i, 0)
        for j in range(max(i - 6, 0), i + 1):
            total += timeseries[j]
        result[i] = total / 7
    return result

assert np.array_equal(moving_average(DATA), moving_average_branchless(DATA))
```

This won't speed up our code, because the branch we just replaced is very predictable.
After the first 6 iterations, it's never taken.
So a branchless solution is still doing extra, unnecessary work for the vast majority of iterations:

```{python}
#| echo: false
%%compare_timing --measure=instructions,branch_mispredictions
moving_average(DATA)
moving_average_branchless(DATA)
```

## Move edge-case handling into a separate code path

A better solution is to handle the first 6 days separately, with their own code path.
That means the rest of the calculations can safely assume that 7 days of data are always available:

```{python}
@njit
def moving_average_3(timeseries):
    result = np.empty(timeseries.shape, dtype=np.float64)

    # Handle the first 6 days specially:
    first_day = timeseries[0]
    for i in range(6):
        total = first_day * (6 - i)
        # Fill in missing values for first few days:
        for j in range(i + 1):
            total += timeseries[j]
        result[i] = total / 7

    # Then handle the bulk of the data:
    for i in range(6, len(timeseries)):
        total = 0
        for j in range(i - 6, i + 1):
            total += timeseries[j]
        result[i] = total / 7
    return result

assert np.array_equal(moving_average(DATA), moving_average_3(DATA))
```

This version is faster, by removing work from the main loop:

```{python}
#| echo: false
%%compare_timing --measure=instructions
moving_average(DATA)
moving_average_3(DATA)
```
