# What is the Practice of Parallelism?

All of the code you've seen until now runs on a single CPU core at a time.
But modern CPUs typically have many cores, and to maximize your code's speed you'll want to take advantage of all these cores.
This is the Practice of Parallelism.

TODO some more specific defintion of what a CPU core, and diagrams of timeslicing vs parallelism, and a bit of historical context?

> You can also go beyond using a single computer, and spread your computation across multiple computers.
> While in some ways this is an extension of the Practice of Parallelism, it also adds additional complications: from network latency to unreliable communications.
> I would therefore consider it a different practice, the Practice of Distributed Systems.
> As such, it is beyond the scope of this book.

### Next steps {.unnumbered}

A good first step in adding parallelism is considering how, architecturally, you will add it in.
That is the topic of the next chapter.
