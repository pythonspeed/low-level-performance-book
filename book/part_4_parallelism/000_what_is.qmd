# What is the Practice of Parallelism?

All of the code you've seen until now runs on a single CPU core at a time.
But modern CPUs typically have many cores, and to maximize your code's speed you'll want to take advantage of all these cores.
This is the Practice of Parallelism.

> You can also go beyond using a single computer, and spread your computation across multiple computers.
> While in some ways this is an extension of the Practice of Parallelism, it also adds additional complications: from network latency to unreliable communications.
> I would therefore consider it a different practice, the Practice of Distributed Systems.
> As such, it is beyond the scope of this book.
