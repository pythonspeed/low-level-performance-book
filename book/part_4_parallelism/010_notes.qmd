# TODO

* Threads vs processes
* Maximize cores used
     * _Computing_ thread per core _across the whole operating system_
     * Hyperthreading
     * Use separate threads for I/O and for compute: blocking network and disk APIs can reduce utilization
* Make sure you understand libraries' existing threading models and don't fight them (or configure appropriately)
* Release the GIL
* Avoid race conditions
* Models of parallelism:
    * Full isolation
    * Worker pool (with fixed size queue for backpressure)
