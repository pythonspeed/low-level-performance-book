# TODO

* Hyperthreading


# MAYBE DONE

* Memory bandwidth limitations; mentioned at least, maybe merits its own section, or is that too in dpeth?
* Models of parallelism, probably needs more work?

# DONE

* Make sure you understand libraries' existing threading models and don't fight them (or configure appropriately)
* Threads vs processes
* Release the GIL
* Avoid race conditions
* Maximize cores used
     * _Computing_ thread per core _across the whole operating system_
     * Use separate threads for I/O and for compute: blocking network and disk APIs can reduce utilization
