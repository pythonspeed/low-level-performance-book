#  First, do no harm {.unnumbered}

Imagine you are working on an application that makes someone sick every time you run it.
This is bad.

Then, you make it 10Ã— faster: now you can make ten people sick in the same amount of time!
Your software has gone from bad to worse.

**If your software harms people or harms the environment, making it faster will amplify the harm.**
So if your work does cause harm, you shouldn't be reading this book, you should be looking for a new project or a new job.
