# Roadmap: Use this book to speed up your code {.unnumbered}

How you read this book will depend on your immediate goal, and on how much time you have.

## Goal: Improve your skills

Reading a book can be helpful to build a mental map of performance bottlenecks, and how you can solve them.
This map can both help you write faster code from the start, and help you know what to do when you do hit a specific performance problem.
Depending how much time and interest you have, you can:

1. Read the whole book, start to finish.
2. Or, read from start to finish, but skip optional chapters.
   Optional chapters are marked with "⋯" symbols, so they will have titles that look like this: *⋯ An optional chapter ⋯*.

## Goal: Fix a specific performance bottleneck

### Step 1. Figure out how you will measure speed

### Step 2. Apply the Practice of Algorithmic Efficiency

Algorithmic efficiency won't necessarily give you the biggest boost to speed.
Beyond the speed benefits, it can also help you _understand_ your code better, which is very helpful in applying other practices.

### Step 3. Apply additional practices as needed

#### Pure Python code

#### Using an existing compiled extension library like NumPy or Pandas

#### You're using
