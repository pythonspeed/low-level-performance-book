#  Is this book for you? {.unnumbered}

Before reading this book, you should make sure it's relevant to your needs.

## First, do no harm

Imagine you are working on an application that makes someone sick every time you run it.
This is bad.

Then, you make it 10Ã— faster: now you can make ten people sick in the same amount of time!
Your software has gone from bad to worse.

**If your software harms people or harms the environment, making it faster will amplify the harm.**
So if your work does cause harm, you shouldn't be reading this book, you should be looking for a new project or a new job.

## Other criteria

When writing this book I assumed that:

* You're a scientist, data scientist, or software developer who uses Python to do numeric computing or other computationally intensive data processing.
* You need to speed up the time it takes to process bulk data: throughput rather than latency.
  For example, you're processing a giant CSV and only care about the time it takes to finish processing all the data.
  On the other hand, if you're working on a REST API that needs to be consistently responsive to millions of tiny parallel requests, this book will be less helpful.

This book can of course be useful more broadly, but the further you are from the intended audience the less helpful it will be.

One thing I _didn't_ assume is that you know a low-level compiled language; it will help, but knowing Python should be sufficient.
