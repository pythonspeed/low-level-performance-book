# Before you begin {.unnumbered}

This book is still in early access; your feedback can help make it better both for you and for future readers!

The goal at this point is _not_ to find typos or grammar mistakes.
Instead, the goal is to find places where I can improve the content.

- Are you getting bored?
- Is the explanation confusing?
- Do you disagree with what I'm saying?
- Is something particularly interesting or helpful?

Whether it's good or bad feedback, please do share, using the instructions below.

## How to leave feedback

* On a computer, you can select parts of the text with your mouse, and leave feedback on that particular phrase or section using the little pop-up.
* On a touch device, tap the paragraph.
  Once you choose the kind of feedback, for example "Confusing," you can also leave a more extended comment.

## Known typographical and design limitations

The helpthisbook.com service I'm using for early access reading has some technical limitations, so I have temporarily replaced tables and diagrams with text equivalents for now.
In the final version tables and diagrams will look much better.
