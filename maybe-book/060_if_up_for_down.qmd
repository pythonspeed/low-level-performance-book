# Push `if`s up and `for`s down âžŠ

This principle is [due to Alex Kladov](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html).
It has a number of aspects, but as a starting point you can think of it as potential a way of speeding up your code.

When you have an `if` inside a `for` loop, it's going to be run over and over again.
So if there's a way to move that out of the `for` loop, it's possible your code will be faster.

If you are using a compiled language, there are other benefits to avoiding branches, which we'll discuss in later chapters.

```{python}
#| echo: false
%load_ext book_magics
%load_ext line_profiler
```

## Handle `if`s on the summary, not the raw data

Consider a function that counts the frequency of letters in a list of words:

```{python}
from collections import Counter

def letter_frequency(words):
    counts = Counter()
    for word in words:
        for character in word:
            # ðŸ˜¢ An `if` statement inside the `for` loop:
            if character.isalpha():
                counts[character.lower()] += 1
    return counts
```

The check whether a character is a letter or not is happening for every character in the string.

Instead, you can choose to count all characters, and then figure out which is alphabetic in the end, on the much smaller per-character summary.
While this change will remove the cost of the `if` statement, it will also be storing more values in the `counts` dictionary, which might balance things out.

```{python}
def letter_frequency_2(words):
    counts = Counter()
    for word in words:
        for character in word:
            counts[character.lower()] += 1

    # ðŸ˜Ž I moved the `if` statement up and out of the `for` loop:
    final_counts = Counter()
    for character, num in counts.items():
        if character.isalpha():
            final_counts[character] = num
    return final_counts

with open("../data/northanger_abbey.txt") as f:
    WORDS = f.read().split()
assert letter_frequency(WORDS) == letter_frequency_2(WORDS)
```

This version is very slightly faster, at least for English prose:

```{python}
#| echo: false
%%compare_timing
letter_frequency(WORDS)
letter_frequency_2(WORDS)
```

But we can do better.

## Move hidden `if`s out

Sometimes the `if` statement is hidden or implicit, but if you pay attention you'll realize there are additional places you can optimize your code.
Can you spot the hidden `if` in `letter_frequency_2()`?

It's not clear exactly how `character.lower()` function is implemented without reading Python's implementation, but it's reasonable to guess that it needs to check whether or not a character even has a lower-case value[^lower].
Having spotted this, you can use the same trick used above:  moving the lower-casing into the second `for` loop.

[^lower]: And in fact there is an `if` statement in [the implementation in CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/17ac3933c3c860e08f7963cf270116a39a063be7/Objects/unicodectype.c#L192).


```{python}
def letter_frequency_3(words):
    counts = Counter()
    for word in words:
        for character in word:
            counts[character] += 1

    # ðŸ˜Ž I moved the `lower()` statement up and out of the `for` loop, only
    # running it on the much smaller counts object.
    final_counts = Counter()
    for character, num in counts.items():
        if character.isalpha():
            final_counts[character.lower()] += num
    return final_counts

assert letter_frequency(WORDS) == letter_frequency_3(WORDS)
```

This version has a more meaningful improvement in speed:

```{python}
#| echo: false
%%compare_timing
letter_frequency(WORDS)
letter_frequency_2(WORDS)
letter_frequency_3(WORDS)
```
