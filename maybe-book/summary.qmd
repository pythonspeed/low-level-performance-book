# Summary

If this isn't enough: parallelism.

Can parallelize inside the low-level compiled code, or can parallelize at higher level.
Often will want to release the GIL if you're sure no other Python thread will touch the low-level data..

You can also hand-write SIMD, or build an even more realistic mental model of CPU and hand-tune your code for a specific CPU's timing.
